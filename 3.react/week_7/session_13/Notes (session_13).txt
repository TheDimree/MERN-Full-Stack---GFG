-> Redux : It is a JavaScript library that manages global state and can be used in our application.
   -> Redux is a state manager that helps us write application that are developed where we can manage the global state.
   It used a one-way data flow where the UI render based on the state app.
   In a appliation there is only 1 store where we store our global state and we can access that state anywhere in our application 
   -> Benefits of redux 
      -> It can help improve performance of the application.
      -> It also allows us to connect multiple components so that the components can only extracts the data it needs from the store.

   -> How we use redux in react 
       -> redux with react-redux (old)
       -> redux toolkit (new)
    -> Redux architecture 
       -> Store : It is a place where the entire global state of the application lists.
       -> ACTION : are sent or dispatched from the view to reducer to update the state in the store. Actions are plain object with type and payload 
          {
            type:'',
            payload:data
          }
       -> REDUCER : It is a pure function .It have 2 parameter state and actions. It get the actions and update the state of the store 
        
        
         -> redux with react-redux 
            npm i redux react-redux --save 
            -> redux 
                -> createStore : to create a store
                -> combineReducers : combine multiple reducer 
            -> react-redux 
               -> Provider : to provide store to the application 
               -> useDispatch : dispatch actions to update state 
               -> useSelector : to get state from store 

            -> Working flow 
               -> store folder 
                  store.jsx : create store and pass reducer 
                  counterReducer.jsx : create a reducer with state and actions 
                  counterAction.jsx : define methods for actions 
               -> call store in index.js and provide it to entire application 
                 import store from './store/store';
                 import {Provider} from 'react-redux';
                    <Provider store={store}>
                       <App />
                     </Provider>
               -> How we read state in component 
                  useSelector hook 
                  import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
                  import { DEC, INC, RESET } from '../store/counterActions';
                  const {count}=useSelector(state=>state);
                  const dispatch=useDispatch();
        <button className='btn btn-success' onClick={()=> dispatch(INC(5))}> ++ </button>
        <button className='btn btn-success' onClick={()=> dispatch(DEC(2))}> -- </button>
        <button className='btn btn-success' onClick={()=> dispatch(RESET())}> Reset </button>
