   -> Performance optimization 
     -> Error boundaries : they are used to handle errors in react application
        -> 2 ways to handle errors 
          1. try/catch block in each component 
          2. React Error Boundary 
             npm install react-error-boundary 

        -> Fragments and StrictMode 
           -> Fragments : return multiple elements , assign multiple elements in a single variable , rendering a list of fragments . It take less memory.It can't create a DOM node.
             <div>
                //elements 
             </div>
             <> </> : play a role of parent element (wrapper element). It cant take a space.
            <> </>
          -> StrictMode : Lets you find common bugs in your components early during development.
             It helps to identify and detect warnings/errors during the development phase.
               <React.StrictMode>
                 ---
                 --
               </React.StrictMode>
			   
        -> useMemo : it is a hook that lets us cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.It return a memoized value. It only runs when one of its dependencies update.
         This can improve performance of the application.

        -> useCallback : It return a memoized callback function. the child components will not automatically run on every render without any need. they render only when there is any dependencies of usecallback is updated.
