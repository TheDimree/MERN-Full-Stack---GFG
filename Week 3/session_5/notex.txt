-> React Js : It is an open-source , cross-platform Javascript library which is used to develop UI(user interface) (front-end)
  -> It is known as a view layer 
  -> It is maintained by facebook 
  -> With the help of it we can create SPA (Single Page Application)

  ---> Features of React Js 
    1. Component based architecture : reusability.We can divide our UI into seperate peices of code.Every thing in react is all about component.
    2. Support JSX (Javascript XML) : It allows html within Javascript .Browser doesn't understand JSX , thats why react have a babel transpiler which transpile jsx code into js 
    3. Virtual DOM : It is a virtual representation of DOM. When a page is executed , the Vdom take a copy of actual DOM . Next time if there is any update in the real dom , then it compare with the copy , and only the new things are updated in a react dome. That's why the performance is fast.
