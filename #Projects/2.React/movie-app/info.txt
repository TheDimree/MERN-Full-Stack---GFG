-> Using material ui for css: https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/
    -> npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

-> Other installations:
    -> Router = npm i react-router-dom
    -> Redux = npm i react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit
    -> UUId = nmp i uuid
    -> AXIOS = npm i axios
    -> Json server = npm i json-server

=> npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled uuid react-router-dom react-redux  @reduxjs/toolkit axios json-server

    -> For a cleaner view, you can use npm list --depth=0 to show only the top-level dependencies you explicitly installed.
