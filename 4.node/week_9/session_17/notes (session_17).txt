-> Node Js : It is an open-source , cross-platform runtime environment which execute JavaScript code outside the browser (server side , backend)
   -> We can interect with database , perform file system operations and all backend operations.
   -> It is not a langauge or a framework 
   -> Here we write everything in JavaScript.
   -> With the help of Node Js we can develop 
      -> Dynamic Web Applications 
      -> REST API's 
      -> Network based applications 
   -> Node js installation 
      -> Download and install node js 
        https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
      -> ** when we install node , npm is also installed with it 
        -> npm : node package manager (3rd party modules)
        -> to check node and npm is install or not 
           node -v 
           npm -v 
     -> How we run node js program 
         first.js 
         console.log("First node app");

         node first.js 
    -> Node js by default asynchronous(non-blocking) in nature 
    -> Node Js is Single threaded 
 -> Node process model 
    -> Single-threaded event loop 
       Node runs on a single thread , means each request is processed on a single thread.
    -> Non-blocking : It used non-blocking codes, which are asynchronous and accept callback functions.This means that the main thread does'nt have to wait for the background thread to complete asynchronous i/o operations 
    -> Event Loop : Node used event loop to listen for events and receive requests from event queue.Event loop is continuosly runs.

    -> Modules : are the libraries in which we have a functionalities and we can use these functionalities anywhere we need 
       -> import and export 
       -> import : when we want to used some functionalities from the module 
       -> export : when we define the functionalities in the module so anyone import it 
      -> Types of modules 
         -> User Define Module (custum)
         -> Inbuild module (core) (http , fs , events , path , os etc)
         -> Third party module (npm)

      -> How we create user define module (new JS (es6))
      -> Core Module 
         -> http module : create a server
      -> nodemon : 3rd party package for developers . It work on projects , when any changes are occur it restart the server
         npm i nodemon --g 
         nodemon first.js 
     -> fs module : file system or file handling module (file folder operations) 
     -> events module : to perform custom events with the help of EventEmitter class
